## 🧩 Problem Statement

Mask Polymers Pvt. Ltd. provided a real-world problem faced in their operations — the lack of a centralized, digital system to manage Kaizen reports. Their existing process relied on manual report submissions, making it difficult to organize, search, and analyze improvement ideas across departments. They needed a platform that could streamline report management, ensure secure document storage, and offer insights through data visualization.

## 💡 Our Solution

To address this, we developed a Kaizen Management System as an academic project in collaboration with the company. I led the project as a team leader and full stack developer, building the entire system using Next.js, Supabase, and the Google Drive API.

The system includes features for uploading reports, searching with filters, and an analytics dashboard to visualize report submissions by department and theme.

## 🎨 Design & Development Process

We began by designing the frontend in Figma, then converted it into a fully functional full-stack web application by integrating each feature step by step. Users can upload Kaizen reports by selecting a theme, department, and date. This metadata is stored in Supabase, allowing for efficient, filter-based searching of reports.

## 🔐 File Storage

The actual documents are securely uploaded and stored on Google Drive using the Drive API. I also implemented a dynamic analytics dashboard that visualizes key insights, such as the number of reports submitted, categorized by department and theme.

## 📈 Outcome & Impact

This project gave me a strong end-to-end experience in building scalable, real-world software while leading both the planning and technical execution.
